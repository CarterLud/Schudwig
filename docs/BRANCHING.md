# Branching guidance

This file contains lightweight branching guidance you can update as you and your collaborator agree on a workflow.

Recommendations (start simple)
- Use `main` as the protected stable branch.
- Create short-lived feature branches for new projects or changes: `feature/<name>`.
- Use PRs for merging into `main` and request at least one review from the other contributor when the change affects shared files or the gallery.

When to open a PR
- New project added to gallery.
- Changes to `index.html`, shared assets, or docs.
