# Contributing to Schudwig

This document will collect guidelines for contributing to this repository. Keep things simple and explicit so both contributors can follow the same workflow.

Suggested workflow
- Work on a feature branch named `feature/<short-description>` or `fix/<short-description>`.
- Open a pull request when the change is ready for review.
- Leave clear PR descriptions explaining what changed and why.
- Review each other's PRs and request changes when needed.

Adding projects
- Add new project folders inside the appropriate category/owner folder.
- Include a `README.md` within each project folder describing how to run the project locally.

Notes
- Keep changes small and reviewable.
- If a project will be collaborative, place it under the `schudwig` owner folder for that category.
