# Schudwig

Schudwig is a collaborative gallery/collection of small self-contained web projects (games, tools, demos, puzzles, and random experiments) created by Lucas and Carter. The repository is intended as a lightweight shared portfolio and playground for learning collaboration workflows.

Repository principles
- Keep projects plain HTML/CSS/JS for now so they are easy to run and review.
- Keep projects self-contained inside category/owner folders so work is isolated.
- Use simple, discoverable conventions so contributors can add projects quickly.

How to add a new project
- Create a new folder under the correct category and owner (for mutual projects use the `schudwig` owner folder).
- Add the project files (`index.html`, `styles.css`, `script.js`, assets/, README.md inside project folder, etc.).
- Optionally add a simple `tests/` folder with unit tests (we're using unit testing as a practice) and a short `README.md` explaining how to run the demo locally.
- Add your project link to the root `index.html` gallery page when ready.

Docs and collaboration
- See `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md` and `docs/BRANCHING.md` for guidelines and rules.
- Use feature branches and pull requests for collaborative changes (see `docs/BRANCHING.md`).

Future improvements
- Add a small automation script to generate the gallery from project folders.
- Add optional tooling (linters, formatters, test runners) once the team agrees on tool choices.
